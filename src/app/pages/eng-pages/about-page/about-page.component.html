title="FOR GJORCE PETROV"

text="For Patron of the school we have Gjorce Petrov, one of the many Macedonian dignitaries. For Patron we have the name of the man who had faith in the future of Macedonia as Goce, as Dame, his contemporaries. He was born on April 2, 1864 in Varos, Prilep region. He studied in Prilep and Thessaloniki and was a teacher in several cities in Macedonia. From 1895 he became a member of the Central Committee of VMRO. While working as a teacher at the Bitola and Thessaloniki high schools, he published the newspaper 'On Arms'.

Together with Delchev he waged an uncompromising struggle to preserve the independent character of the Macedonian national revolutionary movement from all external attacks, especially by the Bulgarians. He was detained by the Bulgarian authorities and interned in Trnovo and Kazanlak. Together with Delchev, they drafted the Constitution and the Rulebook of the Organization. With a group of Macedonian revolutionaries he was for disapproval and rejection of the decision of the Central Committee in Thessaloniki from 1903 to start the uprising in Macedonia. He deeply believed that the uprising would fail due to insufficient armed readiness and an inappropriately chosen moment, but he took part in the Ilinden Uprising.

After the failure of the uprising, he was deeply disappointed and left for Sofia. After the First World War, he especially fought against the division, the fragmentation of Macedonia, always emphasizing that he is for an independent and sovereign Macedonia. On June 28, 1921, he was assassinated in Sofia by top agents. Professor Gane Todorovski wrote about Gjorce Petrov: 'Gjorce Petrov fell victim to raging murderers because he was a person with incomplete authority. '

After the maturity of his views on the goal and methods of the struggle, after the persistence and the ability to defend the independence of the Macedonian national-revolutionary movement with words and deeds, he is one of the biggest figures of the Macedonian liberation movement in whose ranks he was for 25 years. He played a leading role in the intellectual-ideological design of the Macedonian revolutionary movement and visionary format. And that is why he will not be accidentally chosen as the first victim of the black list of political assassinations in Bulgaria between 1921 and 1934.
Thirty-year-old Gjorche Petrov believes in the own strength of his people and resonates with the mind of a revolutionary leader that victory is revealed through the solution to live freely, that in order to achieve that one must fight for life and death. Gjorce acts from the position of a theorist of the Macedonian revolution on the pages of the magazine 'Loza'. The motto of this magazine was Sophocles's thought: 'A heretic is one who has a better friend than the fatherland.' If Delchev is called the soul of the Internal Organization, Gjorche Petrov is the generally recognized diplomat of the organization. From these Macedonian first apostles, Jane Sandanski also receives her ideological enlightenment. All three fought together against the enemies and the three died from enemy bullets.

From the point of view of careful readers of history we read written about Gjorce: He was a correspondent with the generations that will enter the stage for years and decades, which means not only in his time, but he was ahead of his time. He surpassed his contemporaries and his time in many ways. A cultural figure of a people and a country to which not only the powerful, but also history itself has constantly turned its back.

Through his work, he brightest and most sacredly inaugurates the oath of the Macedonian people that only through struggle can freedom be achieved and that they love their homeland freely. Its tragic end is a testimony to all our tragic calculations, to all that bloody Balkan ball under masks in our history that does not stop playing until today.
Let this moment of celebrating the fiftieth anniversary be just a message of patriotism and staring at the work of the dignified, the Patron of our high school Gjorce Petrov. Gjorce Petrov is a name whose warlike word should be guarded for the sake of national duration, because it is about an actor whose voice is a warning spread all over the furrows and borders of this country to destroy Macedonia and remain a legacy of a strong Macedonian tribe, weed according to Петре М. .Андреевски.

We are facing the obligation to follow the historical vertical of Gjorche Petrov, perceiving the tragedy of the great man, and at the same time let our own excitement be a confirmation that we are strengthening the branches of the generations. Understandably, we owe this sensitivity and respect for the climate of Macedonia to all those who have taught us how to love our native country Macedonia, and among them is the name of Gjorce Petrov. The great actors, like Gjorche Petrov, do not need mediators and long comments because the works are their only identification.
